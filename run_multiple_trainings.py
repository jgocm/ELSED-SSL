TODO: Implement here a script to run multiple instances of training for fitting thresholds
1. Understand what parameters of PSO can be changed to achieve better results
2. Analyze the classes' distribution in the dataset
3. Make a reduced dataset with hand-select images that are well-distributed on the field
4. Perform trainings with randomized annotated line segments using different sizes of training data
    and splitting them into: train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%)

Concurrently, more data needs to be annotated.
